# Impact-Assessment-Dashboard


An Impact Assessment Dashboard was designed to provide a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of multi-dimensional development interventions across various districts and states. The dashboard consolidated large-scale program data into a strategic decision-support tool, enabling leadership teams to track progress, measure impact, and inform future resource allocation.
